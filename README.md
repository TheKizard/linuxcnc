This repo contains sample configs to run a Linear Delta 3d printer with a CRAMPS board, using MachineKit.

Before installing MachineKit, clone this to the /home/machinekit/ directory; it should be found automatically when MachineKit starts up.

Take a look at CRAMPS.lineardelta.{hal/ini} for things to tweak for your particular printer.
